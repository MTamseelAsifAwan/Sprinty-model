SourceTree Shortcut Start In path invalid,Bug,Done,High,06/05/2022 15:03,10/03/2023 4:43,General,"Hello.I recently added a new system drive to my ASUS ROG G751-JY, an M.2 NVMe SSD, in the hopes of gaining a lot of performance with Git and SourceTree, among other tools, by moving my projects from the stock HDD over to an SSD. The stock SSD was out of space, so I got this new one to replace it.When I moved my repository to the new SSD, every SourceTree operation ran extremely slowly, as in it stalled for 20+ seconds just to commit a tiny change or update a view. I tried putting the stock SSD back in and doing the same things, thinking it was the switch from a non-NVMe SSD to an NVMe SSD, but it was the same bad performance.The SSD(s) sit on an M.2 PCI-e interface; the stock one is non-NVMe and the new one is NVMe, so we're also testing the difference between those two. The mainboard's chips limit the bandwidth of the interface to PCI-e 2.0 4X speeds, which should still be magnitudes better than my HDD, but you can see the performance I get.*More info below the results, but you need to see these to care :D**+Time trials of SourceTree:+*¬†*HDD 5400 RPM* (ROG G751-JY {*}stock{*}) - *SATA II slot*¬†- (Seq. read/write benchmarks: {*}101/93{*}):- Show initial ""File Status""¬† - *37.2* seconds- Stage 1 file, few changes - *3.5* seconds- Show History¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†- *5.3* seconds- Random update on File Status - *1.2* seconds*SSD* *NVMe* (ROG G751-JY {*}stock{*}) - *M.2 slot* (Seq. read/write benchmarks: {*}1140/850{*}):- Show initial ""File Status""¬† - *44.5* seconds{color:#FF0000} (+20%){color}, sometimes 125 seconds {color:#FF0000}(+336%){color}- Stage 1 file, few changes - *22.3* seconds {color:#FF0000}(+637%){color}, sometimes 43 seconds {color:#FF0000}(+1229%){color}- Show History¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - *5.3* seconds {color:#ff8b00}(same){color}, sometimes 40 seconds {color:#FF0000}(+811%){color}- Random update on File Status - *18* seconds {color:#FF0000}(+1500%){color}*SSD* *NVMe* ({*}SN850{*}) - *M.2 slot* (Seq. read/write benchmarks: {*}1615/1459{*}):- Show initial ""File Status""¬† - *41.5* seconds {color:#FF0000}(+12%){color}- Stage 1 file, few changes - *21.5* seconds {color:#FF0000}(+614%){color}- Show History¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†- *5.2* seconds {color:#00875a}(-1%){color}- Random update on File Status - *15* seconds {color:#FF0000}(+1250%){color}*SSD*¬†{*}NVMe{*}{*}{*} ({*}SN850{*}) - *External USB 3.0 NVMe interface* (Seq. read/write benchmarks: {*}475/454{*}):- Show initial ""File Status"" - *45.1* seconds {color:#FF0000}(+21%){color}- Stage 1 file, few changes ¬†- *23.5* seconds {color:#FF0000}(671+%){color}- Show History ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - *45.3* seconds {color:#FF0000}(+855%){color}- Random update on File Status - *20* seconds {color:#FF0000}(+1666%){color}+*Result Elaboration and Discussion*+I only included the sequential read/write marks; for the non-sequential tests, the SSDs are 40-400+ times faster than the HDD. I tried on the system partition and a secondary partition.During these stalls, the CPU was at 10-40% usage (spread evenly across the cores) and the SSD at 0-2%. SourceTree would disappear from the Task Manager for most of the time of these stalls; it does that on HDD as well, but usually only for a short while before returning and updating the UI, but in these cases, SourceTree was gone from Task Manager for these long stalls until it finished. I'm on ethernet cable, so it's not Wi-Fi...nothing is stalled on any performance monitors.And I did multiple tests for each of these results, made sure to turn off virus scanners, also adding exclusions for the folders for safety, everything else turned off and shut down. Ensured they were indexed by Windows, as well, like the original repo, and checked folder security settings. I always run SourceTree as Administrator. All that jazz.I'm down to it being Git or SourceTree, that simply do not function well with my harddrives or their ports, or the drivers/interfaces for my ports/drives/mainboard not being optimized for what Git/SourceTree is doing. I've checked everything with these SSDs. They're formatted and adjusted properly, zipping and unzipping is fast and CPU-capped, games install and run using up to 425 MB/sec, and that's just what I've measured ""in the field"", but benchmarks are as expected for the ports, as well. It's just Git/SourceTree.I know that everything on this machine is 6+ years old, but when everything else seems to be able to take advantage of the new disks, I'm running out of reasons to blame my system."

Allow Multiselect Cherry-pick using Interactive Rebase,Suggestion,Done,High,05/05/2022 22:21,10/03/2023 4:43,Bitbucket,"Hi Atlassian,I'm sure you're already aware but would like to bring to your attention the use of Bitbucket App Passwords in Source Tree as a security risk. I'd call it a high security risk because the app password is needed every time we do a git clone and is immediately visible in plain text upon pasting it behind the username. Further to that, after each git clone, in the settings of the project in source tree, you can actually see the full app password in plain text as well. The plain text app password is visible even on workstations with only standard user access. Meaning that even though our environment is setup where all the devs are standard users (instead of local admin users), an attacker who has successfully got into one of our dev workstations (especially if they are familiar with Source Tree), can actually grab the app password in plain text, save it somewhere alongside the path, setup the same path on their Source Tree on their workstation with that app password and start doing commits, push, pulls etc as that user. If that user uses the same app password for each of their project, then essentially and attacker could use that same app password to do git clones from several projects. If that user uses different app passwords for each of their project, then they might not be aware if an attacker has compromised one of their app passwords to do git clones for whichever project. All this pretty much defeats the purpose of turning on multi-factor authentication.a†If there is a better way or more best practice way to authenticate from source tree to Bitbucket (or if our company is just using app passwords wrong entirely), I'm more than happy to hear how we should be doing it instead and push out a new implementation to our devs. But as is, I couldn't figure out a sustainable way to authenticate with Source Tree apart from using app passwords. Have tried using ssh for authentication but that broke after just one day of testing.a†Microsoft has plans to deprecate basic authentication and legacy authentication (this year I believe) which to me means that big corps will start moving away from basic authentication, legacy authentication, app passwords entirely eventually. I would like to know if there are plans to build 2FA authentication into the Source Tree app when using with Bitbucket in the near future as that would be absolutely critical security wise I would think.a†Regards,Brandon Chuah"
Clone Remote - Failure to validate/accept remote repository path,Bug,Done,High,02/05/2022 13:26,10/03/2023 4:43,General,I was recently trying to determine why Sourcetree was so slow and in the process I ran into an issue with the Shortcut Start In path being invalid.The last part of the path was pointing to an older version folder that no longer existed. That older version may have been 3.6.6.I manually updated the path to the latest version folder and all is working fine. I am not sure if this will help with performance but it certainly will eliminate this as a contributing factor.Please look into why the Start In path is not updated as it should when installing an Sourcetree update.Thank you.

When looking at the output, it seems the most time is spent counting remote objects, whatever that means - it seems that there are about 160 000 objects that ""has to"" be counted.a†Nothing remarkable has happened to my repo, i.e., no significant changes in size or content.I have updated SourceTree to the latest version, and also updated the embedded Git in it, but that didn't affect anything, as far as I can see. My operating system is Windows 10, 64 bit version, with all the latest updates installed.Any suggestion is welcome, since this is a huge pain in the *** right now.a†RegardsFredrika†PS. The About window in SourceTree tells me the version is 3.4.8, even though that version is listed as Unreleased in the ""Affects Version/s"" list below.DS."

Denial of service when cloning an empty git repository,Suggestion,Done,Highest,23/12/2021 13:23,10/03/2023 4:42,Git,Team Foundation Server 2015 supports pull requests through their web application and API. It would be a great addition to be able to create and complete these pull requests straight from SoucreTree. I believe TFS 2015 Update 2 has better API support as it's required by the Visual Studio Code extension for TFS.With this in mind it would be awesome to have TFS added as an option when configuring the optional extended integration settings for your repository.

This made it difficult to keep track of what happened after doing several operations.I imagine two ways to do this, possibly done together:1. Keep the ""main"" branch fixed as the left-most branch. If the branch at the top of the list isn't the main branch, then its graph starts in the ""second"" column. (mockup attached)2. Choose a color for the main branch.

AskPass.exe error,Bug,Done,Low,05/07/2021 10:11,10/03/2023 4:38,Git,"I am working with ANSI-encoded files with contents containing German umlauts. After setting Sourcetree's default encoding to ""Windows-1252"", the diffs are shown correctly in the internal diff viewer. However, staging of hunks or lines that involve umlauts fails with the git error ""patch does not apply"".Looking into %LOCALAPPDATA%\Atlassian\SourceTree\LastFailedPatch.txt I found that Sourcetree converts the diff from ANSI to UTF8 to generate the patch file (i.e. umlauts are shown correctly when viewing the patch file as UTF8-encoded). Git does not care about encoding, so it will try to apply the UTF8-encoded patch to the ANSI-encoded original file. This fails whenever the patch contains characters with representations that differ between ANSI and UTF8.In my opinion the correct way to fix this bug would be to stop converting the patch content from whatever encoding it has to UTF8, because git will *not* convert it back to its original encoding before trying to apply it. As a quick test, I converteda†%LOCALAPPDATA%\Atlassian\SourceTree\LastFailedPatch.txt back to ANSI encoding and executed git apply manually, which then worked.a†A similar issue for an older version of Sourcetree has been reported asa†SRCTREEWIN-8768."

For those of us who use multiple external system (e.g. github.com, gitlab.com, self hosted sever, etc), a typical security practice is to use different SSH keys for each system, so that if anyone key was compromised, only one system is potentially affected.

We have a ""book"" file which groups multiple individual Framemaker files together (each of which represents a chapter in the book). Framemaker has a function where you can change some attribute of all of chapters in a book, such as changing the conditions in all the chapters, or updating the page numbering in all of the chapters, or clearing the change bars in all of the chapters. When performing some of these ""group"" actions, each chapter is opened quickly, changed, and then saved again. During this process I get an error message that one of the chapters could not be saved. When I look at the File Status in SourceTree, it shows as a Removed/Deleted file in the Unstaged Files section. I then have to Discard the deletiong and re-do the group action. When I redo the group action, a different file will then get deleted, and so on, over and over again.This is not specific to my laptop - there are 5 writers in our group, and it happens to all of us.This does appear to be specific to either SourceTree or Git, because this only started happening once we started using SourceTree and Git (our files were previously in a Subversion, and we never had this issue).If I move the book and all its chapters OUTSIDE of the Git directory/Sourcetree, and do the same group action, it works fine.a†I updated to the latest version of Sourcetree (3.4.5), because I noticed in the release notes that there was a fix for an issue that SORT of sounded like it might have something to do with this (""Fixed staging modified files with paths longer than 260 characters stages the file as 'Removed'), but updating did not resolve the problem.

When I unstage, the file is deleted. When I add the file via the terminal, it all works flawlessly. I think the tricky thing here is the shared submodule part, with which Sourcetree has trouble. While it could be that I am doing something wrong, I have the belief that Sourcetree is doing more than a simple 'git add' (as that works from the command line).I set up the shared submodule as followed:1. Clone the project that should serve as the shared submodule locally to some directory2. In the shared submodule, modify the local config of this project by adding 'worktree = ..' under [core]For all projects sharing this submodule:3. Add the submodule (this means, effectively I now have two checked out copies of that project)4. Delete the respective submodule folder in ./git/submodule/5. Delete the content of the submodule directory apart from the .git file6. Modify the .git in the submodule directory to point to the path of the project setup in 1)a†(reason for shared submodule is that we have the same code base across different projects, and this way I can change a file in the code base once and it is applied to all projects without having to pull their respective submodule first)"

Detect when external merge tool fails to release conflict files and provide a warning2. Check for presence of unresolved merge conflict files, esp. for recent conflict resolution attempts3.
